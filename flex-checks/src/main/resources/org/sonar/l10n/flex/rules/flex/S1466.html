<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>The Security.exactSettings value should remain set at the default value of true. Setting this value to false could make the SWF vulnerable to
cross-domain attacks.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
Security.exactSettings = false;
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
Security.exactSettings = true;
</pre>
