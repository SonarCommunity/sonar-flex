<p>This rule is deprecated, and will eventually be removed.</p>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>An empty code block is confusing. It will require some effort from maintainers to determine if it is intentional or indicates the implementation is
incomplete.</p>
<pre>
for (var i:int = 0; i &lt; 42; i++){}  // Noncompliant

try {                               // Noncompliant
} catch (error)
{
    ...
}
</pre>
<p>Removing or filling the empty code blocks takes away ambiguity and generally results in a more straightforward and less surprising code.</p>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>The rule ignores code blocks that contain comments.</p>
