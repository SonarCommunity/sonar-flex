<p>Empty statements, i.e. <code>;</code>, are usually introduced by mistake, for example because:</p>
<ul>
  <li> It was meant to be replaced by an actual statement, but this was forgotten. </li>
  <li> There was a typo which lead the semicolon to be doubled, i.e. <code>;;</code>. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
function doSomething():void {
  ;                                                       // Noncompliant - was used as a kind of TODO marker
}

function doSomethingElse():void {
  trace("Hello, world!");;                     // Noncompliant - double ;
  ...
  for (var i:int = 0; i &lt; 3; trace(i), i++);       // Noncompliant - Rarely, they are used on purpose as the body of a loop. It is a bad practice to have side-effects outside of the loop body
  ...
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
function doSomething():void {}

function doSomethingElse():void {
  trace("Hello, world!");
  ...
  for (var i:int = 0; i &lt; 3; i++){
    trace(i);
  }
  ...
}
</pre>
