> We are deprecating the SonarQube Flex analyzer.

> Our plan is to eventually stop maintaining it ourselves, while leaving it available in Open Source, in case the community wants to take it over.
>
> Timeline:
> * August 2024: All rules are now deprecated to let users know of the change
> * January 2025: SonarQube v11 will be the last version to include the Flex analyzer
> * First half of 2025: Flex analysis will no longer be available in SonarCloud
> * First half of 2025: This repository will be archived and remain available online
>
> You'll continue to be able to build the plugin and use it in your SonarQube instance as long as it remains functional. You can also fork the repository and make changes as you see fit.
>
> Thanks to everyone for their involvement!
